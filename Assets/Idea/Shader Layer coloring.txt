weak blending + 2/3 color checker looks really good (like in desert) 
maybe adding the option to randomize the color by cell on a list of chosen colors could be good

would need the shader to be able to color entirely one cell, 
maybe the uvs could be all vertex from one cell at the same spot
and the texures could be generated using position
